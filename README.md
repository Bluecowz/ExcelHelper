Hello!
* This program handles spreadsheet manipulation for work. Because it is a pain in the ass.

Handles my excel spreadsheets for work. 

At work we use Excel spreadsheets for work so I designed this to handle the excel manipulation for me. 

Can add times, descriptions of what I have done, and can send it in an email to whomever needs it.

You will need to add 3 directories to the config file. The path of this program, your timesheet archive folder, and the
template folder to create the timesheets.

TODO:
1) Find a better way to store the password. I understand it is an issue storing it in plain text.
2) Send email in another thread to the UI is responsive.
3) Overall efficiencies are needed.

Dependencies:
Openpyxl version 2.4.1

Config file setup can be found in the example XML file.


Feedback always welcome!
